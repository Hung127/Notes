# This is a heading 1
Hello, this is just some text under the heading 1
## This is a heading 2
AND HERE IS THE *TEXT* THAT IS UNDER HEADING 2
### This is a heading 3
Right below is a c++ code snippet!
```cpp
void func(int n) {
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		std::cout << i << " ";
	}
	std::cout << "\n";
}
```

I think that I should make this text **bold**  
Or maybe *tilt*  
Or even ***tilt and bold***?

I am learning markdown through [this book](https://dl.icdst.org/pdfs/files3/c79990b0b853932d36ddc117ce2503e3.pdf)  
I am testing the link, can you go to my [[README]]?  
I am using [Github](https://github.com) to *sync* my notes!  
This is a list

This is an alternate syntax for heading level 1, just use "\=\=\=\=..."
Just like this

HELLO, *again*  
hey :)  
This is how to use a block quote  
> Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph. A paragraph is defined as ‚Äúa group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit‚Äù (Lunsford and Connors 116). Length and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph. For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long. Ultimately, a paragraph is a sentence or group of sentences that support one main idea. In this handout, we will refer to this as the ‚Äúcontrolling idea,‚Äù because it controls what happens in the rest of the paragraph.

I can even put *2 paragraphs* inside a *quote*

How about nested paragraph?
