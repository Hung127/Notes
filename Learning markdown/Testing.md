# This is a heading 1
Hello, this is just some text under the heading 1
## This is a heading 2
AND HERE IS THE *TEXT* THAT IS UNDER HEADING 2
### This is a heading 3
Right below is a c++ code snippet!
```cpp
void func(int n) {
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		std::cout << i << " ";
	}
	std::cout << "\n";
}
```

I think that I should make this text **bold**
Or maybe *tilt*
Or ***tilt and bold***?
