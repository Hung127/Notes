# Email protocols
Determine how email messages are received, stored, downloaded, removed or retained
## POP3, IMAP4, SMTP
- **POP3** (Post office protocol version 3): Email is downloaded from an email server to a single device, then the email on server is gonna be deleted
- **IMAP4** (Internet message Access protocol): Email can be sync through multiple devices (not deleted from server)
- **SMTP** (Simple mail transfer protocol): Sending emails
