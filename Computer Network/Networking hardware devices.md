# Networking hardware devices 
Enable communication and interaction on a computer network:
- Cables
- Servers
- Desktops
- Laptops
- Tablets
- Smartphones
- IoT devices
Im gonna learn about network devices that connect or route (*hubs, switches, routers, bridges, gateways*).
# Server
A **powerful** computer or device that stores files and applications.
- Other devices on the same network can access to the server -> client
- Users can access server a file or application from anywhere (*if they have proper level of access, usually password-based*)
# Nodes and clients
A node is a network-connected device that can send or receive information
A client is a node that access to the network through a server
All devices that can send, receive and create information on a network is are nodes.
The nodes that access the server to get on the network are clients
The server controls the level of access that clients have -> if a client fails, the network remains unchanged.
# Client-server networks
- FTP sites
- Web server
- Web browser
# P2P network
- Files sharing sites
- Discussion forums
- Media streaming
- VoIP services (*Voice over IP services*)
# Devices
## Hub
- Connects multiple devices together
- When data is sent to a hub, it broadcasts that data to all devices except the sender
## Switch
Similar to a hub but
- Keeps a table of MAC addresses
- When receive data -> look up for proper MAC address forward the data to the right place -> **Just send data to the intended recipient** -> *more efficient than a hub*
> [!NOTES]
> When a switch or a hub fails, it brings **the entire server** down.
## Modem
Switches and hubs connect to modems, if
